  <strong>MY</strong> goal in this class is to help me achive the job and career I want to get as a detective or a computer forensics detective in the police force.
   I want to be able to bring lost files or delted files to an ongoing case.
  With these pictures or documents brought up we can present them in court against the defendant.</p>
  <h2><br>DETECTIVE DEFINITION:</br></h2>
<p class="a">
Detectives are specialized police officers that investigate crimes and gather evidence.
Their tasks include analyzing potential evidence, interviewing witnesses and suspects and assisting
in the execution of warrants.
 Many detectives will specialize in a particular area, such as homicide, sexual crimes, arson or fraud.
 How to become a police detective is to work as a police officer, pass a test,and earn a promotion to
  detective through the department.
 If you want to pursue a career as a detective without going through the police academy and working as an officer first,
you can become a private investigator,or PI.</p>


  <h2><em>Steps to Becoming a Homicide Detective</em></h2>
<ol>
  <br><li>Meet Department Standards;In order to qualify for work as a police officer,
    candidates must hold at least a high school diploma or the equivalent.
    Some employers prefer or require aspiring homicide detectives to have completed some college coursework or
  possess a degree.
Would-be detectives may pursue an associate's or bachelor's degree in criminal justice or law enforcement.
 These programs cover the fundamentals of the field and prepare students for academy training and police work.
  Common courses include criminal law, legal procedures, evidence, forensics, court systems,
  law enforcement procedures, and investigative techniques.</br>
<br>Success Tip:</br>
<p>It is helpful to take foreign language courses in college.
 According to the BLS,
candidates who can speak a foreign language may have an advantage in this line of work.
Homicide detectives may work
with witnesses, suspects, and families who don't speak English. Having the ability to communicate in their preferred
  language can expedite the investigation process.</p>
<p><li>Become a Police Officer;
Prospective homicide detectives apply to the police department of their choice.
While application requirements vary, candidates usually must be 21 years of age or older;
additional requirements can include a high school diploma, a state driver's license, U.S. citizenship,
and a clean criminal record. Qualified candidates then complete training at their employer's approved academy
to become law enforcement officers.
These professionals are responsible for apprehending and arresting criminal suspects,
  writing traffic tickets, and preparing incident reports.</li></p>
<p><li>Get Promoted to Detective:</p></li>
<p>After gaining a certain amount of experience, a police officer can apply for promotion to homicide detective.
 Additionally, some departments require applicants to pass an examination for promotion, while others consider
seniority within the department when making hiring decisions.
Job performance is usually taken into account as well.</p>

 <p><li>Continue Education:</p>
Police officers and detectives must participate in ongoing training. This training may include firearms re-certification
 or courses in law enforcement skills and procedures. Many law enforcement agencies, professional associations,
 and third-party vendors offer continuing education classes, seminars, and training workshops.</li>
<p>
 <li> Gain Experience for Career Advancement:
Some departments have different ranks for homicide detectives. Through experience and continuing education,
a homicide detective may be able to advance in rank within his or her department. More highly ranked detectives
   may be responsible for overseeing lower-ranked detectives and regular police officers.</li></p>
 </ol>
